**tested with Odoo 14**

If there is a website specific (custom) template, you can reset it now.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:


Usage
-----

In the website, open `Customize` -> `HTML/CSS/JS Editor`. If the current template was
customized and saved for this website, you should see the red ``Reset`` button next to
``Format``.


Notes
^^^^^

In the Odoo ``web_editor`` app, there is a comment and user error
``Reseting views is not supported yet``. I cannot say for sure that the here implemented
way of resetting the templates to the installation default has any unknown side effects.
